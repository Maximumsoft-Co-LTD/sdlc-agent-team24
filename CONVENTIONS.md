# SDLC Conventions — read24

This project uses a typed-markdown SDLC ledger under `docs/sdlc/`. Every artifact is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that doubles as a queryable dependency graph.

## File layout

- `docs/sdlc/requirements/` — REQ-XXXX (what the system must do)
- `docs/sdlc/designs/` — DES-XXXX (how we'll do it)
- `docs/sdlc/adrs/` — ADR-XXXX (architectural decisions)
- `docs/sdlc/tasks/` — TASK-XXXX (executable work)
- `docs/sdlc/tests/` — TEST-XXXX (verification)
- `docs/sdlc/deployments/` — DEP-XXXX (rollouts)
- `docs/sdlc/operations/` — OPS-XXXX (incidents / ops events)
- `docs/sdlc/sprints/` — SPRINT-XXXX and SPRINT-XXXX-retro
- `docs/sdlc/growth/` — per-role growth notes from retros

## IDs

IDs are zero-padded counters per type (e.g., `REQ-0001`, `TASK-0042`). Use `node scripts/next-id.js <type>` to get the next free ID.

## Relationship fields

Every artifact may carry these frontmatter list fields:

- `implements:` (task/design → requirement)
- `designed_by:` (task/code → design)
- `verified_by:` (task → test)
- `deployed_in:` (task → deployment)
- `blocks:` / `blocked_by:` (task → task)
- `related:` (catch-all)

These define edges in the graph emitted by `scripts/sdlc-graph.js`.

## Status values

`proposed | approved | in_progress | blocked | done | cancelled`

## Risk values

low, medium, high, critical

## Sprint length

14 days.

## Workflow

1. PM-agent drafts a requirement → status `approved`.
2. Architect-agent drafts a design → status `approved`. Lock the design's **Pre-Implementation Specs** before opening any task.
3. PM-agent creates tasks → assigns to dev role(s) by setting `owner:`.
4. Dev-agent claims the task (`task-progress-update <TASK> in_progress`), invokes `git-workflow start <TASK>`, implements, runs `code-reviewer`, opens a PR via `git-workflow open-pr`, then merges via `git-workflow merge`.
5. QA-agent runs tests; if any fail, the linked task is reverted to `blocked` and `git-workflow resync` is triggered for any dependent open branches.
6. DevOps-agent cuts releases (`git-workflow release-start` / `release-finish`), tags `main`, and runs `deploy-runner` so linked tasks get `deployed_in:` stamped with the `git_tag`.
7. At sprint end, sdlc-orchestrator runs `sprint-retrospective`.

## Git workflow

GitFlow branches (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`) with **one git worktree per task** under `.worktrees/<TASK-ID>/`. PRs go through `gh`. Full reference: **`GIT_WORKFLOW.md`**. Runnable steps: **`.claude/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md`**.

Never edit code in the main checkout. Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`. Never force-push to shared branches.

### Task-level lock

A task is locked to its `owner:` while `status: in_progress`. No other agent may start it. The frontmatter is the lock; git is the artifact; they must always agree (run `node scripts/sdlc-propagate.js` after any status change, or rely on the PostToolUse hook).

## Coordination modes (sync · parallel · resync)

When 2+ agents work the **same goal** (e.g., multiple tasks under one requirement), the sdlc-orchestrator (or PM) declares one mode per goal and records it in the sprint doc:

- **sync** — tasks share contracts; do them one at a time. One worktree active per area.
- **parallel** — tasks touch disjoint surfaces proven by the design's *System Dependencies*; each owner runs their own worktree. Daily `git-workflow sync` rebases onto `develop`.
- **resync** — a parallel branch fell behind, or a contract moved, or QA found drift. Affected tasks → `blocked`; each owner runs `git-workflow resync`; contract conflicts go back to architect-agent.

Sprint doc snippet:

```yaml
coordination:
  goal: REQ-0012
  mode: parallel          # sync | parallel | resync
  tasks: [TASK-0042, TASK-0043]
  resync_trigger: "any merge to develop touching DES-0007"
```

## Versioning & history

- `main` is tagged using **SemVer 2.0** (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- `vX.Y.0` tags come from merged `release/*`; `vX.Y.Z` (Z>0) tags come from merged `hotfix/*`.
- Each tag round-trips to a `DEP-XXXX` deployment doc whose `git_tag:` field is the same string. The SDLC ledger is the human-readable history; `git log --tags --oneline` is the machine-readable one.
- Never rewrite a tagged commit. Use `git revert` to undo merged changes; the revert is itself a ledger event.

## Graph export

`node scripts/sdlc-graph.js` → `docs/sdlc/_graph.json` and `_graph.mmd`. These are git-ignored. The graph renders a **release lane** by reading `git_tag:` on deployment docs.
